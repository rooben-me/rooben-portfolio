# MyPricing Assistant: An Intelligent Repricing App Assistant

Hello everyone,

I am excited to share with you my latest project, which I built for BoostMyShop. In this blog post, I will explain the motivation behind this project, how it works, what is the use of this project, and how I built it.

## Our problem

Boostmyshop mypricing is a powerful tool that can help online businesses boost their sales volume to the maximum, and our team recognizes the importance of providing exceptional customer support for the success of our project. However, this requires a significant amount of effort from our core team members.

As we discovered the capabilities of ChatGPT, we wondered if we could develop a bot using its underlying technology, GPT-3, to handle basic queries about mypricing. Although ChatGPT itself does not have an API, we embarked on a journey to explore the feasibility of using GPT-3 to create a bot that could answer common technical questions related to mypricing.

## Fine tune gpt-3 ?

In order to make GPT-3 more knowledgeable about the specifics of mypricing, we needed to find a way to train it on our data. We identified the help center on Boostmyshop as a valuable source of information, as well as customer conversations which could provide valuable questions and answers to be fed to GPT-3.

Initially, we considered using GPT-3's fine-tuning capability to create a customized model trained on mypricing knowledge base. However, the cost of $80 per retraining session was prohibitively expensive, especially if we wanted to retrain daily to keep our bot up-to-date with the latest changes in the application.

As a result, we ultimately decided to move forward without fine-tuning.

## GPT-Index to load data

After scraping knowledge about mypricing from various sources such as Boostmyshop's main website, help center, and release note website, we had a wealth of information in text form. However, it was not practical to expect GPT-3 to process all of this information at once. To address this, we took the following steps:

1. We sliced the documents into smaller, more manageable chunks, with each chunk on a new line.
2. We queried these chunks to identify the most relevant ones that could help answer the question.
3. We provided GPT-3 with the most relevant chunks to assist in answering the question.

To simplify the chunking and querying process, we turned to GPT-Index. This tool helped us streamline the data and enabled us to efficiently provide GPT-3 with the most relevant information.

## Coverting Text to Vectors :

We start by creating an index of this data with the [GPTSimpleVectorIndex()](https://gpt-index.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guides/index_guide.html#vector-store-index). This will turn all the text data to vectors:

![vector_store.webp](/image/work/mypricing-bot/vector_store.webp)

This is how the words will be represented in vectors :

![text2vec.png](/image/work/mypricing-bot/text2vec.png)

## Querying vectors :

Querying a vector store index involves fetching the top-k most similar Nodes, and passing those into our Response Synthesis module.

Now, we've built a way to both store our chunks and query them.

## Giving this knowledge to langChain :

LangChain provides a standard interface for agents, a selection of agents to choose from, and examples of end to end agents. Agents involve an LLM making decisions about which Actions to take, taking that Action, seeing an Observation, and repeating that until done.

> Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. But using these LLMs in isolation is often not enough to create a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you are able to combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

Next we need to give our LLM Agent (i.e. GPT-3) a way to use this knowledge. So let's give it [tools](https://langchain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/agents/tools.html?highlight=tools). In our case, we just have 1 tool - `querying_db`.

Here's how you do it (check out the amazing [Langchain documentation](https://langchain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/agents/tools.html?highlight=tools) to learn more):

This will give the results in a text form.

The result of the langchain agent with be the final answer showed in the image above.

## Creating UI with Gradio :

Gradio is one of the *best ways to share* your machine learning model, API, or data science workflow with others is to create an *interactive app* that allows your users or colleagues to try out the demo in their browsers.

Here are three reasons why you should use Gradio to create interactive apps:

1. **Easy to Use**: Gradio allows you to build demos and share them all in Python with just a few lines of code. This means you don't have to worry about learning new programming languages or frameworks.
2. **Efficient UI Creation**: One of the best things about Gradio is that it takes care of the UI for you. You don't need to spend time creating custom styles or layouts for your app. Instead, you can simply call the Gradio component and let it handle the UI. This frees up your time to focus on what you do best - building great machine learning models and workflows.
3. **Highly Customizable**: Gradio is also highly flexible, so you can tailor your app to suit your specific needs. You can choose from a range of input and output types, such as images, text, and audio. This allows you to create a demo that truly showcases the power of your model or workflow.
